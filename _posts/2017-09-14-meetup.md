Our September 2017 meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK.

Ashton Baker discussed the R package `pomp`, which allows users to build, test, analyze, and fit HMMs to data. Hidden Markov Models are useful tools for explaining time-series data.

Rami Krispin gave an overview of the `plotly` package and its uses, pros and cons, and then gave a demo of the nice features of the package. ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/RamiKrispin/Plotly-Meetup/e652f5e988ec5c7798f1094e0196b320969dcdff/Plotly_AA_Meetup.html))
