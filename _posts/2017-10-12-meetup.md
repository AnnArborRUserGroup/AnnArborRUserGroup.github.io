Our October 2017 meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK. ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/2871443c04f24999f18e4dece4b36edafbe94037/2017-10/announcements/announcements.html))

Andrew Moore talked about building bivariate choropleths with `leaflet` and `tidycensus`, illustrating with NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center) data. This included a brief overview of the `tidycensus` package, a newly developed package following tidyverse conventions to return queries from the census API. He also covered how `tidycensus` and `leaflet` can be used in tandem to efficiently build interactive choropleths in R, without the need for additional GIS software.
