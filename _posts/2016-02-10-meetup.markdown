<!-- Please join us for the February 2016 installment of our monthly meetup series!

This month's meetup will be hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK (big thanks to Travis Linderman!), who will also be providing food for the group (probably pizza).

We'll have two short talks, one on web scraping and the other on deep learning, followed by a longer presentation on programming and debugging; see the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Ann-Arbor-R-User-Group/events/228436525/) for details!

The Februrary meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK (big thanks to Travis Linderman!); check out the [announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/f145727c9ea99b1c7c1581a4d3e816d7956a00e6/2016-02/announcements/announcements.html) for the latest group updates. There were two lightning talks, one on web scraping and the other on deep learning, followed by a longer presentation on programming and debugging.

The lightning talks were:

* "Deep Learning with H20" ([code](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/tree/master/2016-02/Brandon-lightning-talk)) presented by Brandon Stange

* "Scraping Web Content Using rvest" ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/f145727c9ea99b1c7c1581a4d3e816d7956a00e6/2016-02/jeff-lightning-talk/rvest-aarug-20160210.html)) presented by Jeff Shane, and

For our main presentation Reino Bruner gave a talk on Defensive Programming and Debugging in R ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/f145727c9ea99b1c7c1581a4d3e816d7956a00e6/2016-02/reino-defensive-programming-debugging-R-Studio/Presentation-revealjs.html)).

Reino Bruner is an R statistical programmer and data scientist with [Equastat](http://equastat.com/). His academic background is in experimental psychology, physics, and statistics. He has experience in many domains including, but not limited to: experimental design, assessment design & validation, statistical modeling, machine learning, model automation, causal analysis, and critical thinking. His research experience and interests include Bayesian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis, neuro-network deep learning, nonparametric and robust statistics, complex system simulations, machine learning, and forecasting.
