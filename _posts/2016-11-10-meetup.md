The November meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2016-11/announcements/announcements.html)).

Ellis Valentiner gave a presentation titled "How to turn your existing functions into a RESTful web API" ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2016-11/plumber/plumber-presentation.html)). REST is a simple but powerful architecture that statisticians and data scientists can use to deliver models and results. In his presentation, Ellis introduced the plumber package and showed how to create and use APIs to provide data science services without messy code handoffs.

Ellis is a Data Scientist at Powerley, a startup that's creating home energy management solutions, and an organizer for the Ann Arbor R User Group.
