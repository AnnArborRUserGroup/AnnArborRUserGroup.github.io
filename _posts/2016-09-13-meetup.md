The September meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2016-09/announcements/announcements.html)). This meetup was held jointly with the Ann Arbor chapter of the American Statistical Association. 

Daniel Kessler gave a talk on using R and Stan to model racial disparities in police use of force, in particular fatal shootings ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2016-09/police-shootings/police-shootings.html)). His work is an extension of a paper by Cody Ross, which used a multi-level Bayesian approach to arrive at both national- and county-level estimates.

Dan and his colleagues became interested in the work, and thanks to the code and data for the paper being publicly available, were able to first reproduce many of the key results, and then replicate several using an independent dataset covering another time period collected by the Washington Post. This is an evolving, live project, and you can follow along at the project's [github](https://github.com/dankessler/Police_Shootings) repository.

Daniel Kessler is a Research Computer Specialist in the University of Michigan Health System's Departments of Psychiatry & Radiology and a Developer for the Neuroimaging Methods Core. With a background in biological psychology and statistics, and an autodidactic proclivity for machine learning and computer science, his interests lie at the intersection of statistics, data science, behavior, and cognitive neuroscience.
