Clayton Yochum demonstrated the use of the recipes, rsample, parsnip, and yardstick packages to pre-process, fit, and evaluate models on the Titanic dataset. These tidymodels packages are the brainchild of Max Kuhn, author of the caret package and the book "Applied Predictive Modeling". Kuhn joined RStudio last year with the goal of replacing caret with a set of smaller, more focused packages following modern tidyverse conventions.
