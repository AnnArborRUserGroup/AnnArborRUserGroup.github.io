There was a free two day Beginner R Workshop at Ann Arbor SPARK on Saturday March 4th and Sunday March 5th.

The workshop gave an introduction to data types, data frames, packages & R Markdown, data manipulation with the dplyr package, data visualization with the ggplot2 package, and data analysis.

The workshop lessons are available ([here](http://annarborrusergroup.github.io/BeginnerWorkshop/)) in the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) format.
