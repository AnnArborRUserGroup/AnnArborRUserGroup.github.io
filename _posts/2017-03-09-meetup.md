The March meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2017-03/announcements/announcements.html)).

We had a special guest speaker, Claus Ekstrøm, who talked about Reproducible Research and some work he's done to simplify that process. Claus was followed by AARUG member Mochan Shrestha, who showed us how to use Google's TensorFlow from R ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2017-03/reproducible-research/dataMaid.pdf)).  

Claus Thorn Ekstrøm is Professor at the Section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen where he teaches courses on statistics and R for beginners and advanced users. Professor Ekstrøm’s primary research interests lie within statistical genetics, genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics, in particular genetic association studies, image analysis of microarray scans, and integrated analysis of gene expression and metabolic profile data. He is the maintainer of several R packages (MESS, dataMaid, SuperRanker, MethComp) and author of The R Primer ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2017-03/tensorflow-in-r/TensorFlow%20and%20R.pdf)).
