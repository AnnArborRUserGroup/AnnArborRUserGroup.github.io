We held our first Beginner R Workshop at Ann Arbor SPARK on Saturday April 2nd and Sunday April 3rd.

The workshop gave an introduction to data types, data frames, packages & R Markdown, data manipulation with the dplyr package, data visualization with the ggplot2 package, and data analysis.

Materials from the workshop are available ([here](http://annarborrusergroup.github.io/AARUG-R-workshop/)).
