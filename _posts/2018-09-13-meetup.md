We fit 3 separate talks in this month:

- R and SAS and R - Barry DeCicco: The R package knitr allows R to be used in conjunction with other software package, and not just as a way to produce better output. This presentation showed us how to use R/RStudio/knitr to call SAS and vice-versa. ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2018-09/R-and-SAS/Calling%20R%20from%20SAS%20(AARUG%20Meeting%2C%20Sep%2022%2C%202018).pptx))

- Have Env -- Will Travel: Colin Gross examined the use of R environments in the context of processing performance data. Software that generates tailored feedback summaries based on psychological theory needs to annotate performers based on their performance data. The annotations are tags such as "capability barrier" and "performance gap". A hurdle for implementing these annotations is that each client has a different way of calculating them. Managing different annotation calculations can be accomplished by leveraging R environments.

- FiraCode in RStudio: Kraig Stevenson demonstrated how to use the [FiraCode font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) in RStudio, a code-centric ligature-enabled font that makes your R code even more beautiful.
