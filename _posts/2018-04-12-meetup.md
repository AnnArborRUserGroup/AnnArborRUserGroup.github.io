For our second April meetup we heard talks on Bayesian Modeling with `brms` and `rstanarm` and on Blogging with `blogdown`.

Alice Milivinti gave us an overview of what Bayesian analysis is and compared the `brms` and `rstanarm` packages, giving pros and cons of each along with code examples.

Xiaosong Zhang introduced the `blogdown` package, an effort by RStudio to reduce the cost of communicating data-intensive material. Xiasong demonstrated creating and publishing a blog from scratch in just a few minutes.
