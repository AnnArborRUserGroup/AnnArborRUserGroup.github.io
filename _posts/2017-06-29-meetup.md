Our June 2017 meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK.

Nan Hanagud gave an introduction to Prophet, an open source time series forecasting tool by Facebook available in R and Python ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/V3g4/ProphetIntroSlides/09597b6abcdc02d29908fc10cc1183b97a5eb791/DemoSlidy.html)). Nan recently started as a Business Intelligence Principal at XPO, where she plans to use R for proof-of-concept type projects. Nan has Master's degrees in applied & computational math and operations research.

Andrew Moore demonstrated how RMarkdown can be extended as a report writing tool to produce inline citations and reference sections for technical and academic writing ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/6dba7f363f9a0e0453f64a3c880088f72293e77d/2017-06/rmd-citations/rmd-citations.html)). Andrew Moore has a BA in psychology and works at the University of Michigan School of Social Work as a data analyst. He is one of the Ann Arbor User Group's co-organizers.
