Colin Gross gave a brief explanation of non-standard evaluation (NSE) and how to use the value stored in a variable as part of `tidyverse` code. Illustrated by handling a case where column names are not known until runtime. ([website](https://grosscol.github.io/tidy-eval/#/))

Joshua King presented an overview of the capabilities of RStudio's flexdashboard package. This package combines functionality from static graphics and interactive htmlwidgets into a self-contained dashboard using R Markdown syntax. He will go through the construction of a demo dashboard for the best pizza/taco restaurant this country may never know.
