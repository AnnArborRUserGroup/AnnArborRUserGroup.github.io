The February meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2017-02/announcements/announcements.html)).

Ellis Valentiner gave a short recap from rstudio::conf(2017L). Ellis is a Data Scientist at Powerley, a startup that's creating home energy management solutions, and an organizer for the Ann Arbor R User Group ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/2804d25b5c6c2fec0cc366c7c27df373a5d8a074/2017-02/rstudio-conf/rstudio-conf.html)).

Kaitlin Flynn gave a talk on creating beautiful plots using the ggplot2 package. Kaitlin Flynn is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Pat Schloss at the University of Michigan. Kaitlin uses R and machine learning to understand relationships between gut bacteria and human diseases like colon cancer ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2017-02/IntroToGgplot/R_users_meeting_ggplot.pdf)).

Geof Hannigan presented on the use of Neo4j with R to store data in a graph database and do graph-based analysis. Geof is a microbiology postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan and an organizer for the Ann Arbor R User Group. He uses graph analyses to better understand the networks of microbes in the human body and how they are associated with disease ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2017-02/neo4j-r/Rusers-NetoworkingWithR.pdf)).
