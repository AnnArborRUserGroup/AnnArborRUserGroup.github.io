Kaitlin Flynn gave a talk on creating beautiful plots using the ggplot2 package. Kaitlin Flynn is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Pat Schloss at the University of Michigan. Kaitlin uses R and machine learning to understand relationships between gut bacteria and human diseases like colon cancer.

Geof Hannigan presented on the use of Neo4j with R to store data in a graph database and do graph-based analysis. Geof is a microbiology postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan and an organizer for the Ann Arbor R User Group. He uses graph analyses to better understand the networks of microbes in the human body and how they are associated with disease.
