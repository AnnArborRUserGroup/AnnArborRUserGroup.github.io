Our November 2017 meetup was hosted at Ann Arbor SPARK. ([announcement slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/8094ec09/2017-11/announcements/announcements.html))

Rob Weyant talked about the basics of package development in R using his own package [`spotifyr`](https://github.com/rweyant/spotifyr) as an example. He covered the key components of package development and some of the useful tools available in R and integrated into RStudio ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/8094ec09/2017-11/pkg-dev-spotifyr/package-dev.html), [`spotifyr` demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/8094ec09/2017-11/pkg-dev-spotifyr/spotifyr-demo.html))
