In September we had two presentations: Mochan Shrestha presented on the caret package, a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models; and Kraig Stevenson gave an introduction to text mining with R and its application to song lyrics.

Mochan Shrestha is a software engineer with a background in computer science (PhD, Wayne State University) and mathematics (MS, Michigan State University). In his talk, Mochan demonstrated how to perform predictive modeling using the caret package. He covered applications for classification and regression ([slides](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/blob/master/2015-09/caretpres/caretpres.pdf)).

Kraig Stevenson has always been interested in what data tells us about the real world. His educational path has taken several twists and turns, from a BS in Statistics and MS in Biostatistics, to a PhD in Bioinformatics, during which he worked with next-generation sequencing data to better understand the regulation of gene expression. After his PhD he began his career as a Data Scientist at Trinity Health. In his talk, Kraig introduced concepts of text mining related to song lyrics. Kraig developed a R wrapper for the musiXmatch API to extract lyrics from a particular artist and apply general text-mining techniques to better understand the content in a corpus of text ([slides](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/master/2015-09/lyricsNLP/lyricsNLP.html)).
