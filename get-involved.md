The Ann Arbor R User Group is a local community group

## Attend the Meetups

We hold a regular meetup about once a month. Meetups are free and everyone is welcome to attend.

The typical format is group announcements, followed by a couple of short presentations (lightning talks), and then a longer main presentation.

Be sure to RSVP on our [Meetup page](http://meetup.com/Ann-Arbor-R-User-Group/).

### Give a lightning talk or presentation

If you want to step up your involvement, consider giving a lightning talk or presentation.

#### Lightning talks

Lightning talks are quick (5 minutes) talks. Since they are short we usually have several (2-4) lightning talks by different members.

Lightning talks are a good place to introduce yourself to the group and show other people how you use R.

If you're learning a new package, working on a side project, or creating a cool Shiny app, lightning talks are a great way to show your progress to the group.

Some recent lightning talks:

#### Presentations

Presentations are longer talks (30-45 min). Since they are longer we usually only have one presentation, but sometimes members want to give presentations around a similar topic and it's nice to have them back to back.

If you're an expert with a package (or you wrote a package), ..., or want to just show how to tackle a problem in R, presentations are a great way to ...

If you're intested in giving a lightning talk or presentation be sure to checkout the [Presentations README](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations).
